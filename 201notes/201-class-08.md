# Class 8 - CSS Layout

[Home](https://justinhamerly.github.io/reading-notes/)

- by default elements are inline or block - but css allows us to change that.
- block level elements start on new lines where inline elements fit within the line.
- elements on the page can be thought about as containers that can contain other containers.  percentages set in css refer to the amount of space taken up in the parent container.
- types of positioning: normal, relative, absolute, fixed, floating

> ## Properties for changing positioning
>
> |property|description|
> |:---|:---|
> |position: static|normal flow|
> |position: relative|relative position to where it would be within normal flow still affects other elements position|
> |position: absolute|the position doesn't influence other page elements|
> |position: fixed|the position stays fixed in relation to the browser window - for example: header nav bars|

- the position of elements in the z axis can be controlled when items overlap each other using z-index: position#
- with the float feature - elements in normal flow will be positioned to the right or the left.  you then need to give the width of the container a value.
