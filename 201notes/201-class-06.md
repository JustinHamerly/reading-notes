## OBJECT LITERALS

- an object is a group of functions and variables that create something.
- the variables that are part of an object are its properties.
- functions in an object are methods - repeatable tasks within the object.
- dot notation uses the object name followed by a dot **(.)** and then the variable or method associated with that object.

## DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

- The DOM is how your script interacts with the browser
- The browser created and strores a model of a page when it lowads.
- the dom tree breaks a page into nodes used for navigation.
>Nodes:
>- Document node - the first node at the top of the tree
>- element nodes - for navigation and finding specific pieces
>- attribute nodes - part of the element nodes that specify behaviors with CSS
>- text nodes - kstored within element nodes - cannot have children nodes.
- the DOM works with nodes representing the elements on the page - but people use element and element node interchangeably.
- you can store the location of a node/element within a variable - this is **caching** the selection.
- DOM methods can return more than one delection in a NodeList - which is an array.  You then can specify the index number to identify specific elements.
- you can amend or change the content of a node after accessing it.
