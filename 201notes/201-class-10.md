- JavaScript is constantly stacking code in order to execute functions.
- When script enters new content, it prepares the content before it executes the content.
- It is important to think of code in levels or groups of execution content.  Content that depends on each other need to be within the same level.  If they aren't in the same level there will be an error because of scope.
- JavaScript uses *lecxical scope* meaning functions are linked to the object they are defined *within*.

>7 Types of Javascript Errors
>
>- Error - generic
>- SyntaxError - syntax not followed
>- ReferenceError = when a variable isn't declared or isn't in scope
>- TypeError - unexpected data type
>- RangeError - numbers aren't in range
>- EvalError - eval() function used incorrectly

- the console shows the line where it *notices a problem with the code* which isn't always where the actual problem is.
