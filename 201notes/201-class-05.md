## IMAGES

- should be stored natively to your project/webpage.  we should use relative links instead of absolute links.
- the alt attribute is where a description is given that can be read by screen readers and used if you can't see the image.  the title attribute creates a tooltip when hovering over the image.
- the align attribute is outdated and we now use CSS to control positioning on the page.
- websites use jpeg, gif or png images normally.  
- it is good habit to save images to sizes based on pixels instead of centimeters or inches. 

>### Image Formats
>- jpeg - good when there are lots of colors in the photo.
>- gif/png - best if your images are flat colors - like logos or some artwork and diagrams.
>- svg - vector images that are infinitely scalable without becomming blurry.  they use points with connected lines.

- transparency is available with gif and png file formats.  Usually png is preferred, and gif is for animated images.
- `<figure>` is a box that can contain one or multiple images within.  
- `<figcaption>` element adds a caption within the figure element.

## COLOR

>- ### Ways to Express Color:
>- RGB value - defining the amount of red green and blue
>- HEX codes - uses 6-digit codes and a # indicator
>- color names - 147 predefined colors
>- HSL/HSLA - hue, saturation, lightness and alpha (transparency)

## TEXT

- leading (pronounced ledding) - describes the vertical space between lines of text.
  - horizontal alignment - left, right, center, justify (fills the box except the last line.)
- kerning - describes the horizontal spaces in text.  Both word and letter spacing are accounted for here.
  - vertical alignment - baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, text-bottom
