## FORMS

- buttons, drop downs, check boxes, text fields... they are all forms.
- forms allow users to interact with your page
- servers process the information in forms and can store the data in a database
- *form validation* is a term for letting the user know their form isnt filled in correctly.  This is often done with javascript, but HTML5 has methods too.

## EVENTS

- Events occur and are windows in which Javascript can trigger functions
- To trigger events - we have to select the node we want the event to bind to and state the code that triggers the event.
- Elements can be bound to events in three ways - HTML event handlers (outdated and should not use), DOM event handlers, and DOM Event listeners (preferred)
