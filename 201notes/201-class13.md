- cookies were invented as a persistent local storage method, but they don't store very much, and they slow down web applications.
- when Microsoft invented internet explorer they added a feature for userData - which stores data but doesn't have any permissions form and no way to increase storage 
- Flash also released a feature that gave 100 KB of free storage and then prompting if storage should be increased.
- All early browser storage options were limited to a single browser or reliant on 3rd party plugins.

- HTML 5 storage is a way of storing information, and you can even leave your browser, and it works in pretty much any browser.
- localStorage is an object that is an array of information linking data with Javascript.
- Data in localStorage is stored as stringss.  If you need to convert that data to another data type, it needs to be coerced through javascript.
