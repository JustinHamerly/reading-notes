- when setting width and height on a canvas element, it should be set within the HTML element.  If you try to set it in CSS it can distort your chart.
- putting stuff inside the canvas tag will not normally show, but is rather, fallback data that renders only if the browser doesn't support the canvas element.
= the canvas is a grid of pixels, with the (0,0) coordinate at the upper left, and the y axis moving down and the x axis moving right.
- canvas uses tools for drawing by specifying pixel coordinates and different drawing commands 
- color and gradients can be made in canvas
