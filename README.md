## About Me

My name is Justin.  I am changing careers from architecture to coding and software development.  I also have my own soap business that I run on the side, where I make and sell bar soap.  I am interested in developing new skills, because I believe in having a growth mindset.

### Growth Mindset

Having a Growth mindset is about believeing in developing new skills and being open to learning.

- *Believe* in your ability to **grow**
- Be **open** to learning skills you haven't ever tried.
- Stay *optimistic* about your journey and realize it is about the journey and **learning** along the way.
