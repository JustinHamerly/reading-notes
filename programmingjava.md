# Programming with Javascript

[Home](https://justinhamerly.github.io/reading-notes/)

---

- code is executed in the order it is written - from line one down.
- this flow is changed using loops and conditionals
- JavaScript uses many different types of operators.
    
    *example: **=** is an assignment operator, and **==** is a comparison operator*

- function parameters are listed in ()
- function arguments are the values received by the function
- variables within functions are local to that function.  they wont be able to be used outside of that function.  This means, you can have the same variable name in different functions doing different things.
