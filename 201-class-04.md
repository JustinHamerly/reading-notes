## LINKS

- links use the `<a>` element and the *href* attribute tells the link where to go.
- Link text goes between the opening and closing tag.
- when linking to pages on the same site a *relative* link is used where an *absolute* link is used for external sites.
- with relative URLs you can move backwards by using **../**  for example:  if you want to link back to a home page and you are two directories forward, the link href would look like **../../index.html**
- **mailto:** is used within the href to create an email link
- **target="_blank"** is the attribute used to make a link open in a new window.
- parts of the same page can be linked to by referencing the ID.

## LAYOUT

- CSS treats each HTML element as a box.  It may be helpful to think of elements within other elements as boxes within boxes.

>### POSTIONING SCHEMES

>- Normal flow - every block level elements appears above or below existing block level elements.
>- Relative Positioning - Shifts an element from its position without affecting other surrounding elements.
>- Absolute positioning - elements are positioned only in relation to the element they are contained in.
>- Fixed positioning - Positions an element in relation to the browser window.
>- floating element - takes an element out of normal flow and positions it somewhere else where it becomes block level and other content can flow around it.

## LAYOUT GRIDS

- grids are a tool used to make formatting web pages consistent, and they are also a tool for keeping design clean and easy to manage.
- CSS stylesheets can be used to manage the rules for a grid layout.
- if you use multiple style sheets you can link them all separately in the HTML or you can have a masster stylesheet that contains links to the other stylesheets.

## FUNCTIONS, METHODS and OBJECTS

- **function** - a group of statements that performs a specific task.
- **method** - a type of function that is part of an object
- **built-in object** - part of the browser's toolkit.
- after a function is created it can be called anywhere in the code.
- some functions take parameters in the () after the function name - but not every function takes parameters.  The () will still be needed even if there aren't any parameters.
- it is important to consider **variable scope**.  If a variable is created within a function, it can only be used within that function.
