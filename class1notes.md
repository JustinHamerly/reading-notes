# This is where I will put my reading notes for markdown.

Markdown is a way to format content on your webpage on GitHub.  You can take your text and format it using characters.  It is like a simpler form of HTML used within GitHub.

An example is making a text bold like the following:
**This is important**
To make the text bold the markdown looks like this 
`**This is important**`
The double asterisk encasing the text makes the text bold.
