## WIREFRAMING

- taking pen and paper layouts and translating them to a layout.
- This layout is a barebones design of the layout.
- Wireframes should be simple.
- Some user interface designers prefer pen and paper, and others prefer to use digital tools

#### Two types of Wireframes
- pen and paper
- digital wireframe

#### User flow
- user flows and information architecture is like the wireframe identifying how different elements flow or connect to each other.

#### Testing

- use simple text and elements to test the flow.  Don't start adding the content in this step.  It is just for testing functionality and layout.

## HTML

- HTML is a markup language.  **H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
- HTML defines content on the page, but doesn't style the page.  HTML is only the foundation of the page or the content.
- tags - HTML uses opening and closing tags to identify an on page behavior.
- elements - identify the opening and closing tag.  the function of the tag.
- attributes - these change the way a tag functions, or gives more specific instruction to the tag
- tags can be nested into other tags
- Empty elements are tags that don't need a closing tag.

## SEMANTICS

-Some HTML tags have inherent meaning.  The tag itself gives meaning to the content.  It is important to use semantic elements when appropriate rather than using tags that dont have any inherent meaning or semantics.
