## Structure

- HTML is used to outline structure.  Structure helps the user digest the content seamlessly.
- HTML elements are used to break down the structure into parts.
- a **tag** is what lies in the brackets.  an **element** is comprised of opening and closing tags and the content contained within.
- **attributes** are added to the opening tag to assign more qualities or information to the element.

## Extra Markup

- Doctype declaration tells the browser what version of HTML to expect.
- comments can and should be added to code, including HTML, to give the person reading the code more information.
- **id attributes** give elements a unique identifier.  CSS can use these IDs
- **class attributes** are used to identify groups of elements to be treated the same through CSS.
- **block elements** start on new lines, while **inline elements** continue from wherever they have started.
- **div elements** are used to put elements together into a block.  **span elements** work similarly to div elements, but operate inline instead of block, and they usually have an ID or CLASS attribute.

## Process and Design

- The first step of designing a site, and the highest priority, is to identify the audience.
- **site maps** are used to create flow and visualize the structure of the site.  The designer can identify sections, groups and pathing through a site map diagram.
- **wireframes** are used to break down the appearance and layout of specific pages.
- identifying heirarchy on a page is important, and there are lots of tools to do this visually such as *size, color* and *style*

## Javascript ABC of programming

- a **script** is simply a set of instructions for the computer to follow.
- When writing a script, we break down the tast of the script into checks and logical instructional steps.
- **flowcharts** are useful for breaking down a script into parts and understanding the flow of the instructions.
- we can create objects in javascript w/ data.  The **properties** define qualities of the object.  **events** can make chanes to the state of objects.  **Methods** are the ways in which we interact with, or make changes to the object.
