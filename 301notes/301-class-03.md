## **Lists and Keys**

Source: [reactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

- *What does .map() return?*
- a new array
- *If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?*
- Using curly braces {}
- *Each list item needs a unique ____.*
- key
- *What is the purpose of a key?*
- gives each item an identity in React.

## **The Spread Operator**

- *What is the spread operator?*
- a tool for spreading an array into separate arguments
- *List 4 things that the spread operator can do.*
- making each item in an array a separate argument, combine objects, concatenating or combiniing arrays, copying an array
- *Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.*
- `const arrOne = [1,2,3]; const arrTwo = [4,5,6]; const arrThree = [...arrOne, ... arrTwo]`
- *Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.*
- `const arrOne = [1,2,3]; const arrTwo = [...arrOne, 4, 5, 6];`
- *Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.*
- `const objectOne = {dog: "woof"}
const objectTwo = {cat: "meow"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, cow: "moo"}`

## **Passing Functions between Components**

- *In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?*
- creates a function that maps through the array.
- *In your own words, what does the increment function do?*
- It passes in an argument, and checks for that argument within the array that is mapped through.  Then it increment the count on that array item.  It then updates the state on that component.
- *How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?*
- add a key on the return in the return referencing the function, then pass "this" with the name in the child compoent in the parent function
- *How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?*
- using "this"

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to better understand when "this" is used outside of a constructor function.
