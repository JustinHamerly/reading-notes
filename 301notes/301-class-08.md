- *REST APIs are designed around a ____.*
- resources aka any kind of object, data or service accessed by the client

- *What are the most common HTTP verbs?*
- get, post, put, patch, delete
- *What should the URIs be based on?*
  nouns - representing the resource they are, and not a verb.

  `https://adventure-works.com/orders` is good vs `https://adventure-works.com/create-order` which adds a verb.
- *What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?*
  It means you need to send multiple requests to find all the data you need.  This increases the load on the web server and should be avoided if possible.
- *What status code does a successful GET request return?*
- 200 (OK)
- *What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?*
- 404 (Not Found)
- *What status code does a successful POST request return?*
- 201 (Created)
- *What status code does a successful DELETE request return?*
- 204 (No Content)
