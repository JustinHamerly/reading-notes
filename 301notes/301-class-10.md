## **Understanding JS call stack**

source: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

- *What is a ‘call’?*
- a function invocation
- *How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?*
- one at a time
- *What does LIFO mean?*
- last in first out.  the last function to run will be the first out in the stack.
- *Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.*

```
Function calls in script:

functionA();
functionB();
functionC();

The Stack:

functionC();
functionB();
functionA();
```

- *What causes a Stack Overflow?*
- When a function calls itself over an over again without an exit point, it will eventually hit a maximum stack call and give the stack error.
