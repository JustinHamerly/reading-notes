**What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**

Home computers came on the scene and were marketed primarily towards men and boys.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

It builds an assumption that if you want to study anything with computers, you likely already have exposure.

What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

- The population is 6% asian, but interestingly, companies have a higher percentage of asian employees than the US population.
- the population is 61% white, and that is almost on trend with the percentage in each of the companies listed.  the average may be a little lower than 61% but it is pretty close.
- The female to male ratio is low almost across the board, but it also seems company dependent.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When they come from the top down, and are driven by company leader commitments.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Diverse teams can find faster/better ways of solving problems, and are more creative when it comes to problem solving.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

Having a diverse company means you can build something that takes into consideration perspectives from different backgrounds.  For example, if you have someone who is colorblind on your team, it is easier to build something that effectively takes that into consideration into your product and as a result, you introduce a wider audience to your product.  If you have solely non-colorblind people develop accessibility options in your app it is more difficult to come up with creative solutions to open up your product to that audience.
