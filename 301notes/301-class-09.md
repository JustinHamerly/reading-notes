## **Functional Programming Concepts**

- *What is functional programming?*
- a way to build elements of computer programs - it avoids changing-state and mutable data
- *What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*
- no observable side effects, and always returns the same result if given the same argument.
- *What are the benefits of a pure function?*
- easy to test, predictable
- *What is immutability?*
- not being able to be changed or reassigned
- *What is Referential transparency?*
- the combination of having a pure function and immutable data.

- *What is a module?*
- code split up into smaller functions into parts.  those parts that we can call upon are called modules.  It is a separate file.
- *What does the word ‘require’ do?*
- pull modules into other files.
- *How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?*
- `module.exports = SAMPLEFUNCTION` in the module.
- *What do we have to do to make a module available?*
- `const SAMPLEFUNCTION = require(./FILENAME)` in the file we are bringing the module into.

## Things I want to know more about

- application of functional programming.  where is this technique important, or used.
