# Revisions and the Cloud

Git allows you to save versions of your code without making a new file.  A new updated version is added as a revision or a commit or a snapshot.  This is essentially doing the same thing as 'save as'.  The versions are saved within the file, rather than a new file.  We add descriptions to these versions to track the changes.

GitHub is an example of a version control system.  

Version control can be Local, Centralized, or Distributed.
