    example: !== means strictly not equal

### Other types of operators:
    
- arithmetic
- bitwise
- logical 
- string

## LOOPS

loops are used to repeat an action multiple times

WHILE LOOPS
    
    use when we don't know how many times the user will need to answer correctly
    
    if the input is true we need to change the condition it is testing inside of the while loop so it doesn't go into a continuous loop.

FOR LOOPS

    when you know how many times you are going to run you use a FOR loop.
