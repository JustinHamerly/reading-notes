# Class 36 - Application State with Redux

---

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?*

Redux can handle state outside of the components, all in one place, and can inject its state into components that needs the updates.

### *What is the purpose of a reducer?*

A reducer takes the initial state, and returns a restructured version of that state to change state without affecting the source.

### *What does an action contain?*

an action has a type - which identifies how to reduce the state, and a payload - which is the state to be reduced.

### *Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?*

we don't want to alter the original state.
