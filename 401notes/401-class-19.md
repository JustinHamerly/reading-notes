# Class 19 - AWS: Events

---

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server*

Both run CRUD operations.  Both require functions to be triggered upon some sort of change or request from the client side.  

### *List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each*

AWS has unlimited server capacity so scalability is a huge selling point of their databases.  Encryption and security are also a focus of AWS.  
Drawbacks are an unclear billing structure, and workflow feels a little more clunky because lots of parts and services need integration so there can be problems computing over the cloud.

### *Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?*

In terms of data structures, they mean the same thing.  Queue can also refer to the order eventsare handled in event-based architecture.

### *How can the server be assured a message was properly received?*

I'm not sure.  Using signatures?

## Vocabulary

|Term|Description|
|:--|:--|
|Serverless API|An API that uses cloud based computing.  The code is hosted in pieces rather than all in one place|
|Triggers|In AWS it is the signal for an AWS Lambda function to fire.|
|Dynamo vs Mongoose|Dynamo is an AWS database, and mongoose lets you deploy from anywhere.  Mongoose uses JSON based data explicitly, where Dynamo uses keys and values.  Dynamo is more of a black box with an interface via AWS where Mongoose is more transparent|
|Dynamoose vs Mongoose|They are both tools for interacting with their respective databases.  Dynamoose documentation is a little sparse where mongoose's documentation is more comprehensive.|
