## *Write the following steps in the correct order:*

>Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret  
>Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party  
>Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint  
>Receive authorization code  
>Make a request to the access token endpoint  
>Receive access token  
>Make a request to a third-party API endpoint  

## *What can you do with an authorization code?*

The authorization code is for making a request to verify your identity, or some other information in exchange for an access token

source: [oauth](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/authorization-code/)

## *What can you do with an access token?*

access a third party API endpoint

## *Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?*

with OAuth the token isn't seen by the user, and the transaction is secure.  OAuth is a tested and tried authentication service, whereas writing my own basic authentication could have lots of security flaws.
