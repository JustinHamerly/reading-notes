## *When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?*

Basic auth is using a username/password or any credentials to access an API.  Bearer auth uses an authorization header to trade for a token giving access to an api.

## *What does the JSON Web Token package do?*

the jwt package is a tool used to create tokens and authenticate clients by comparing encoded and decoded JSON data.

## *What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?*

It should be hidden to protect the server.  This means adding it to an env file, or some other hidden file that wont be visible in a deployed setting.
