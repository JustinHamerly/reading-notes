# Class 32 - Context API - Behaviors

---

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?*

It depends on a few things.  If you are using class components, passing down a bunch of state properties for context could be hard to handle, but if those contexts are usually used together you could group them into one render property to make this easier.  If your app has a lot of different contexts with a lot of different use cases, it may be easier to use functional components.

### *What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?*

anytime we have global data we want to share among many components.  Authentication is a good use for this, or passing consistent design effects to components.

### *How can you best test context?*

You can do end-to-end tests by using the browser to render the whole app, or you can render components and component trees in a mock test environment.  Jest and React Testing Library are two tools used to test React components.
