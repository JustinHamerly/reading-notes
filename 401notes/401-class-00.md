*Tips for solving programming problems*

- make sure you spend time understanding the problem fully before attempting to write any code.
- solving the problem manually first is important because it can identify problems before any code is written.
- Pseudo-code, or coding written in notes/english are written in order to make sure you are grasping what you are doing before doing any coding.
- optimization should always be the last step in writing code and solving coding problems.

- everything around you will take up your time if you don't value your time.
- busyness and stress are signs of being off-track.
- people will typically treat you with the value you assign to yourself.
- it is important to learn when to say yes and no.

## **How to think like a programmer**

- a lot of this is about how you don't just try to blindly solve problems until they "happen" to work, and how you should have a plan to understand and solve the problem fully.
- understanding the problem fully is the first step, otherwise your solution only happens by chance.
- Planning is all about organizing the steps to solving the problem.
- Break up the larger problem into manageable smaller problems you can tackle one at a time.
- reassessing, debugging, researching - these all happen when you get stuck.

## **The Five Whys**

- When you have a problem, you should keep asking why to boil down the root of the problem, rather than dealing with the surface problems.
- this technique is about countermeasures, not necessarily solutions.
