### *Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)*

It is a class that can only have one instance constructed.

### *Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes*

The singleton instance is global, so all node modules can access it.

### *If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?*
