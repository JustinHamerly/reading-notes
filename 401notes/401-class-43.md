# Class 43 - Open-Source Software Contribution

Open source contribution is a way to get people in the public to contribute to public coding projects.  Github has a recommended flow for how to do this.  Github is also the largest resource for open source software contribution.  They have resources allowing people to follow open source projects, as well as tools to make the process simple, and a library of projects that actively seek open source contribution.  This could be a great way to dip into more diverse code projects without having to start from scratch.

Motivations for contributing to open source projects can vary.  Maybe you want to build skills, or maybe you believe in the mission of an open source product and contributing is fun and rewarding for you holistically.  You can also develop some portfolio pieces this way and become more hirable through your work and demonstrating an exemplary contributing nature.

Personally, I look forward to exploring open source projects and seeing how I can contribute to a community through code.  That journey hasn't begun for me, but I aim to find a project that looks interesting enough to me to want to build it out further.
