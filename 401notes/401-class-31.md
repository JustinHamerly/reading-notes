## Review, Research and Discussion

### *Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()*

We want to use `useState()` if we are managing the state of simple, primitive data, and `useReducer()` when we want to manage state as an object or an array.

### *Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?*

"Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it."

### *What do custom hooks usually do?*

When two functions share logic, we can make a third function - a custom hook - that both functions can use.

### *Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications*

There are a bunch of them listed at the source below. useCounter is a hook for counters.

### *Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work*

making an API call, then managing state with `useState()` to track the data we pull from the api, and and `useEffect()` to update components.
