### *What is the difference between a framework and a library?*

A framework is a third party set of code that we insert our code into.  It has its own syntax and rules, and you follow all of those to stay within the guidelines.  In a framework our code is layered into the syntax and rules of the framework.

A library is a third party piece of code that we bring in for some functionality, and this is layered into our code.  

It is a spectrum though, and the terms can be blurry, but it mostly depends on the amount of code we are using from a third party in relation to the code we write.
