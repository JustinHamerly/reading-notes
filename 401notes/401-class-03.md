### *Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware*



### *True or false: The route handler is middleware?*

false, middleware use the next() function.

### *In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?*

`response.end();`, `response.send('message')`, `next()`

### *At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?*

After an HTTP request is made, and before the request returns a response.

### *What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”*

maybe the request was called twice, or two different requests were made at the same time.
