# Class 28 - Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

---

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?*

Because we can set up a router with React that loads all 'pages' in one html file window, essentially letting us switch and replace the window with different react components.

### *If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?*

Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`

### *What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested*

It unmounts the components and mounts the components for the new route.

### *What does props.children contain?*

The components within the parent component

### *How do useState() and this.setState() differ?*

useState() is a hook for functional components, that rewrites the entire state object.  With class components we can use this.setState() to change part (or all) of the state of that component.
