### *What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?*

source: [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/blog/put-vs-patch/)  
Both are part of the Update portion of CRUD.  
`PUT` Put is similar to Post in the sense that it creates resources, but it needs to update an existing resource rather than creating something new.  The entire entity is replaced.
`PATCH` updates and existing resource, and we can choose to update parts of a resource rather than overwriting the whole thing.

### *Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server*

source: [NORDIC APIs](https://nordicapis.com/how-to-mock-web-services-during-development/)  
This article lists a few tools for mocking web services and outlines some of their differences.  Three listed are:  
[Sandbox](https://getsandbox.com/)  
[Karate](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate)  
[Mockable](https://www.mockable.io/)  

### *Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?*

source: [stackshare](https://stackshare.io/stackups/apidocjs-vs-swagger-inspector)  
`Swagger` is a free cloud-based API testing documentation tool and generates OpenAPI documentation  
`APIDoc.js`  creates documentation from API annotations in your source code. 

>REST Status Codes:  
source: [restful api](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)  
`200` OK  
`201` Created  
`202` Accepted but the process hasn't been completed  
`204` Successful, but no content in the call  
`301` Indicates the resource has been redesign and moved somewhere else, and it should specify a new URI  
`302` Found is a way of performing URL redirection  
`303` See Other - sends a reference to a resource, rather than sending a potentially unwanted response body.  
`304` Not Modified - the response body is empty when the resource hasn't been modified.  
`307` Temporary redirect.  Indicates the request wont be processed, but future requests should still use the original URI  
`400` Bad Request - a generic unsuccessful request  
`401` Unauthorized - indicates request may have used incorrect credentials  
`402` Forbidden - the resource is restricted and needs permissions to be accessed  
`404` Not Found - resource isn't found but gives no indication of whether or not this is temporary or permanent  
`405` Method not allowed - used an HTTP method not permitted  
`406` Not acceptable - api isn't able to give preferred media types indicated by the Accept request header.  
`412` Precondition Failed - some condition wasn't met for the API request  
`415` Unsupported media type - Not able to process based on what is supplied in the Content-Type request header  
`500` Internal Server Error - generic API error response.  This is never the client's fault.  
`501` Not implemented - usually implies future availability but currently doesn't recognize the request method

### *Compare and contrast SOAP and REST*

source: [stackify](https://stackify.com/soap-vs-rest/)  
Both are web service communication protocals.  `SOAP` used to be the standard approach to web service interfaces, but `REST` now dominates.  
`REST` Allows a variety of data formats whereas `SOAP` requires XML format  
`REST` is focused on performance and is generally faster.  
`SOAP` is easier to operate across firewalls and proxies without needing to modify the protocol.
