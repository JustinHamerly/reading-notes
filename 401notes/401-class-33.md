## Review, Research and Discussion

### *Why is the Context API useful?*

It lets us pass conditions to many components without using props.

### *Can a component outside of a provider get its context?*

yes, with the useContext() hook.

### *What are some common use cases for using the Context API?*

authentication, user preference data, theme data

### *Describe “Context Hell”*

When you have many contexts wrapping a component.  You may want to refactor to consolidate these contexts if you have too many context components that are all being used in the same place.
