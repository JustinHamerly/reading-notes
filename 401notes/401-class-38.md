# Class 38 - Redux - Asynchronous Actions

---

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *How granular should your reducers be?*

They should handle a singular change and be predictable.

### *Pro or Con - Multiple reducers can "fire" when a commonly named action is dispatched*

Definitely a pro.  If multiple states need to change at the same time, (like in our lab with the store category and store products), it makes a lot of sense to fire off the change of both those things at once.  Sure, you might have to be careful not to accidentally name two actions the same when you don't want that to happen.

### *Name a strategy for preventing the above*

be specific with your action type naming.

|Term|Description|
