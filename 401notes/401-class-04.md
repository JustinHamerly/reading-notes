### *Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development*

- helps troubleshoot for edge cases
- ensures you don't get ahead of yourself if something in your code is broken
- test writing practice - it ensures you know what is happening in your code assuming this is white box testing and you are the one writing the code base, and the tests themselves.

### *In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?*

- before each will set up the dependencies for the test, and afterEach() will remove the dependencies when the tests are finished.

### *What is one downside of Test Driven Development*

- I can think of two - it is easier to lose your flow of just writing the code if you are testing along the way... you may become sidetracked.  Also, if the requirements of a project shift or change, the tests you have written may have to be altered as well.

### *What's the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?*

- ES 6 classes make it easy for us to create subclasses and pass the properties of the parent class to the subclass.  We can do this in a constructor/prototype, but it is a lot more steps and less intuitive.

### *Why REST?*

- REST gives us a consistent ruleset for handling resources in a database

|:--|:--|
|functional programming|Don't have classes, or abstractions.  The only goal of functional programming is to getting an expected outcome.  It isn't about the process or the how, but more about the what, and this makes it declarative and not imperative, like OOP.|
|object-oriented programming (OOP)|Deal with objects or abstractions.  Imperative programming that is focused on the 'how'  In object oriented programming, we care more about behaviors of objects and abstractions.|
|class|a template for creating objects in object-oriented programming|
|super|a method of passing properties from a parent class to a subclass.  This is how subclasses inherit traits from their parents.|
|this|a reference to the current object, or instance of an object|
|Test Driven Development (TDD)|development in which coding, testing, and refactoring are happening simultaneously|
|Jest|a framework for javascript testing|
|Continuous Integration (CI)|a practice in coding in which incremental changes are committed and merged with other team members work.  this is useful for version control and keeping the main deployed branch manageable and up to date with what we want there.|
|REST|a framework and process for CRUD operations that is manageable and consistent.|
|Data Model|an abstraction of a real life object or concept into code.  Helps create networks of relational data.|
