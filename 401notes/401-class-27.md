# Class 27 - useState() Hook

## Review, Research and Discussion

### *How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?*

React is a framework by which we can create components, and control state with web apps.  It uses JS/HTML and CSS, but within its rules and constraints.  It allows us to compartmentalize our code and the state of our apps in an easy to manage way.

### **What is the primary difference between a functional component and a class component?**

Class components use an object to set state, and use `this` to reference functions and properties in state.  A functional component is just a javascript function, and state is managed through hooks - aka other functions.

## Vocabulary
